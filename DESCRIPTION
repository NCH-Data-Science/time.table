Description: Often when dealing with messy, real-world time series data, we have many variables sampled at different frequencies or sampled intermittently. The 'time.table' library provides functions to easily wrangle these different variables into a uniformly-spaced tabular format. This package uses the high-performance, memory efficient 'data.table' as a backend.
